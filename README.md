# R-HTA

[R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) is an consortium focused on popularising the use of R for health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). The main body of R-HTA includes members primarily from the Americas and UK, who have diverse experience in government (including [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/) in the UK), academia, and industry. The aims of R-HTA, in general, are to:
- Provide discussion on the many R [packages](https://r-hta.org/#resources) available to HTA analysts;
- Assist users to get the most out of R for cost-effectiveness analysis; and
- Host [presentations](https://r-hta.org/#talk) and [public discussions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUog4U8cjXuQIvINSDsiEJQ) to facilitate the development of R for HTA

**‘R-HTA in LMICs’ is the LMIC-focused chapter of this consortium that aims to introduce and showcase the strengths of R specifically to LMIC analysts and health care institutions**

# R-HTA in LMICs
The **aim** of the LMIC chapter is to bridge the gap in the use of R software among HTA analysts in LMICs. We host both presentation-focused and tutorial-focused R workshops. In the first quarter of every year, we host a presentation-based workshop which encourages LMIC Masters and PhD students at universities and members of other partnership organisations to present their R related health economics work. In every subsequent quarter, we host introductory, intermediate and advanced workshops, applied within an LMIC context, which focus on practical, in-depth topics associated with modelling in R. For example: in introductory workshops, we teach participants the basics of R and discuss how to use several open-source HTA R packages; more advanced topics include developing R-HTA models in interactive formats, using Shiny (click [herehttps://shiny.rstudio.com/]) for details). All attendees are provided with key resources and code used in every workshop.

## But why R?
***R scales efficiently***
- This is especially true when an HTA model becomes increasingly complex compared to other commonly used software (read more [here](https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1098-3015%2819%2930050-6))

***R has an established user-base***
- There are several health economics packages which make coding in R more user-friendly: [BCEA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BCEA/index.html), [hesim](https://github.com/hesim-dev/hesim), [heemod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/index.html), and [dampack](https://github.com/feralaes/dampack)
 
***R ensures reproducibility***
- Models can easily and safely be hosted and shared via services such as [Github](https://github.com/)
- Using [‘version control’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), updates do not ‘break’ models
- With [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), analysts can deliver transparent, reproducible reports and interactive models
