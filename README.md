# What do we do?
## R-HTA
[R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) is an consortium focused on popularising the use of R for health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). The main body of R-HTA includes members primarily from the Americas and UK, who have diverse experience in government (including [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/) in the UK), academia, and industry. The aims of R-HTA, in general, are to:
- Provide discussion on the many R [packages](https://r-hta.org/#resources) available to HTA analysts;
- Assist users to get the most out of R for cost-effectiveness analysis; and
- Host [presentations](https://r-hta.org/#talk) and [public discussions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUog4U8cjXuQIvINSDsiEJQ) to facilitate the development of R for HTA

**‘R-HTA in LMICs’ is the LMIC-focused chapter of this consortium that aims to introduce and showcase the strengths of R specifically to LMIC analysts and health care institutions**
